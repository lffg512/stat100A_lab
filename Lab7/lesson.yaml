- Class: text
  Output: Today we will focus on the following topics

- Class: text
  Output: 1. hypothesis testing for one proportion

- Class: text
  Output: 2. confidence interval for one proportion

- Class: text
  Output: 400 students were randomly sampled from a large university, and 289 said they did not get
    enough sleep. Conduct a hypothesis test to check whether this represents a statistically significant
    difference from 50%, and use a significance level of 0.01.

- Class: text
  Output: We will begin by using a confidence interval to examine this claim and then will conduct a
    hypothesis test using both the test statistic (z score) and p-value approaches.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is p hat, our point estimate?
  CorrectAnswer: 289/400
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(289/400)
  Hint: Use the problem statement to help calculate the point estimate.

- Class: text
  Output: For our confidence interval, we also need the standard error and critical value.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use qnorm(alpha/2) to find -z(alpha/2).
  CorrectAnswer: qnorm(0.01/2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='qnorm(0.01/2)')
  Hint: Use qnorm(alpha/2), replacing alpha with the correct significance level.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now find the standard error for p. Round your answer to 4 decimal places.
  CorrectAnswer: 0.0224
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(0.0224)
  Hint: Use the formula for the standard error in a confidence interval for p.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the margin of error for your confidence interval? Round to 4 decimal places.
  CorrectAnswer: 0.0577
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(0.0577)
  Hint: Margin of error = (critical value) x (SE)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the upper limit of the confidence interval?
  CorrectAnswer: 0.7225 + 0.0577
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(0.7802)
  Hint: Point estimate +- Margin of Error

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the lower limit of the confidence interval?
  CorrectAnswer: 0.7225 - 0.0577
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(0.6648)
  Hint: Point estimate +- Margin of Error

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Based on the confidence interval, do significantly more or less than 50% of students get
    enough sleep? (Is there sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis?)
  CorrectAnswer: Yes, because the null proportion is not in the interval.
  AnswerChoices: Yes, because the null proportion is in the interval.; No, because the null proportion is
    in the interval.; Yes, because the null proportion is not in the interval.; No, because the null
    proportion is not in the interval.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Yes, because the null proportion is not in the interval.')
  Hint: Based on the confidence interval, what is your conclusion?

- Class: text
  Output: To interpret any general confidence interval, we say the following.

- Class: text
  Output: Based on the interval, one can be (1-alpha)100% confident that the true proportion of whatever
    we are interested in is between lower limit and upper limit.

- Class: text
  Output: Just don't forget to fill in all of the details based on the problem statement!

- Class: text
  Output: Let's look at our problem statement again. 400 students were randomly sampled from a large
    university, and 289 said they did not get enough sleep. Conduct a hypothesis test to check whether
    this represents a statistically significant difference from 50%, and use a significance level of 0.01.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We found p hat already. Enter its value again now so that it's easy to find.
  CorrectAnswer: 289/400
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(289/400)
  Hint: Use the problem statement to help calculate the point estimate.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We also found the (negative of the) critical value already, but let's find that in again using
    qnorm(alpha/2).
  CorrectAnswer: qnorm(0.01/2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='qnorm(0.01/2)')
  Hint: Use qnorm(alpha/2), replacing alpha with the correct significance level.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We calculated the standard error for our confidence interval, but it will be slightly different
    for our test statistic. Find that value now.
  CorrectAnswer: 0.025
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(0.025)
  Hint: Use the standard error formula for the test statistic approach.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use this value to find the test statisic.
  CorrectAnswer: 8.9
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(8.9)
  Hint: Use the formula for the test statisic for single proportions.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Based on the test statisic and critical value, what can we conclude?
  CorrectAnswer: The test statistic is more extreme than the critical value, so we reject the null
    hypothesis.
  AnswerChoices: The test statistic is more extreme than the critical value, so we reject the null
    hypothesis.; The test statistic is less extreme than the critical value, so we reject the null
    hypothesis.; The test statistic is more extreme than the critical value, so we fail to reject the null
    hypothesis.; The test statistic is less extreme than the critical value, so we fail to reject the null
    hypothesis.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='The test statistic is more extreme than the critical value, so we
    reject the null hypothesis.')
  Hint: Remember to take the absolute values.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Finally, we want to find the p-value for this problem. Recall that the p-value is 2 x P(Z < -|z|)
    where z is the test statistic. Find this value using 2*pnorm(-|z|).
  CorrectAnswer: 2*pnorm(-8.9)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='2*pnorm(-8.9)')
  Hint: Make sure to replace |z| by the absolute value of your test statisic.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Based on the level of significance and p-value, what can we conclude?
  CorrectAnswer: The p-value is less than alpha, so we reject the null hypothesis.
  AnswerChoices: The p-value is less than alpha, so we reject the null hypothesis.; The p-value is greater
    than alpha, so we reject the null hypothesis.; The p-value is less than alpha, so we fail to reject
    the null hypothesis.; The p-value is greater than alpha, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='The p-value is less than alpha, so we reject the null hypothesis.')
  Hint: How do we use a p-value to draw conclusions in a hypothesis test?

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Based on our hypothesis testing, how would we finalize our conclusion?
  CorrectAnswer: There is sufficient evidence at the 0.01 level of significance to conclude that proportion of students do not get enough sleep is different from 50%.
  AnswerChoices: There is insufficient evidence at the 0.01 level of significance to conclude that more than 50% of students do not get enough sleep.; There is sufficient evidence at the 0.01 level of
    significance to conclude that proportion of students do not get enough sleep is different from 50%.; There is sufficient
    evidence at the 0.01 level of significance to conclude that 50% of students do not get enough sleep.;
    There is sufficient evidence at the 0.01 level of significance to conclude that 72.25% of students
    do not get enough sleep.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='There is sufficient evidence at the 0.01 level of significance to conclude that proportion of students do not get enough sleep is different from 50%.')
  Hint: How do we interpret our conclusion from the previous problem?

- Class: text
  Output: The General Social Survey asked 1,578 US residents, “Do you think the use of marijuana should
    be made legal, or not?” 61% of the respondents said it should be made legal. We want to test whether,
    US residents' approve rate of legal marijuana use is DIFFERENT from 50% at the 0.05 level of significance.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the point estimate for the true proportion of US residents approval rates for legal marijuana use?
  CorrectAnswer: 0.61
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(0.61)
  Hint: Make sure your answer is written as a proportion and not a percent.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the null hypothesis?
  CorrectAnswer: p = 0.50
  AnswerChoices: p = 0.61; p = 0.05; p = 0.50
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='p = 0.50')
  Hint: The null hypothesis is about the true approval rate.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the alternative hypothesis?
  CorrectAnswer: p is not equal to 0.50
  AnswerChoices: p > 0.61; p > 0.50; p < 0.61; p is not equal to 0.50
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='p is not equal to 0.50')
  Hint: We want to test whether the true proportion is "different" from 0.5


- Class: text
  Output: To see if 61% serves as strong evidence, we need to find the distribution of our sample proportion.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: To check the success-failure conditions for CLT, we need to calculate np and n(1-p). Which number would you use for p?
  CorrectAnswer: p = 0.50
  AnswerChoices: p = 0.61;p = 0.50; you can use either one
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='p = 0.50')
  Hint: The distribution for p-hat is found under the null hypothesis, so we use p = 0.5 as in the null hypothesis.

- Class: text
  Output: You can easily calculate np and n(1-p) and verify that both are larger than 10.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the standard error for the sample proportion p-hat?
  CorrectAnswer: sqrt(0.5 * 0.5/1578)
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(sqrt(0.5 * 0.5/1578))
  Hint: Use the formula for SE of p-hat, sqrt(p x (1-p)/n)


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the test statistic (z score)? Round your answer to 0 decimal places.
  CorrectAnswer: 9
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(9)
  Hint: Use the formula for the z score for test of one proportion.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the p-value? Use your test statisic (rounded to 0 decimal places) with 2*pnorm(-z).
  CorrectAnswer: 2*pnorm(-9)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='2*pnorm(-9)')
  Hint: Replace |z| with the absolute value of your test statistic.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Compare the p-value to alpha 0.05, do you have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis?
  CorrectAnswer: The p-value is less than alpha, so we reject the null hypothesis.
  AnswerChoices: The p-value is less than alpha, so we reject the null hypothesis.; The p-value is greater
    than alpha, so we reject the null hypothesis.; The p-value is less than alpha, so we fail to reject
    the null hypothesis.; The p-value is greater than alpha, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='The p-value is less than alpha, so we reject the null hypothesis.')
  Hint: When p-value is small, it is strong evidence to reject the null.


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now let's try the critical-value approach. What is the (negative of the) critical value? Use qnorm(alpha/2).
  CorrectAnswer: qnorm(0.05/2)
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(qnorm(0.05/2))
  Hint: Use qnorm(alpha/2) with alpha from the problem statement.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Compare the critical value to test statistic (z score), do you have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis?
  CorrectAnswer: Yes because z-score > |critical value| so it is in the rejection region
  AnswerChoices: Yes because z-score < |critical value| so it is in the rejection region;Yes because z-score > |critical value| so it is in the rejection region; No because z-score < |critical value|
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Yes because z-score > |critical value| so it is in the rejection region')
  Hint: When z score is in the rejection region, we have strong evidence to reject the null.

- Class: text
  Output: Did you reach the same condlusion using p-value approach and the critical value approach?

- Class: text
  Output: Yes, they should lead to the same conclusion. In this example, we have strong evidence to show the approval rate is not 50%.
