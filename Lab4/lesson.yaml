  Output: We will begin today's lab by working through some conditional probability exercises.
    Suppose 80% of people like peanut butter, 89% like jelly, and 78% like both. Given that a
    randomly sampled person likes peanut butter, we want to find the probability that they also
    like jelly.

- Class: text
  Output: Let J be the event that someone likes jelly and PB the event that someone likes peanut
    butter.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: How would we write the desired information in probability notation?
  CorrectAnswer: P(J | PB)
  AnswerChoices: P(J | PB); P(PB); P(J); P(PB and J); P(PB | J)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='P(J | PB)')
  Hint: We want to find the probability that someone likes jelly given that they like peanut butter.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What information do we need in order to calculate this probability?
  CorrectAnswer: P(PB) and P(PB and J)
  AnswerChoices: P(PB) and P(PB and J); P(J) and P(PB and J); P(J) and P(PB); P(PB), P(J), and
    P(PB and J)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='P(PB) and P(PB and J)')
  Hint: What's the formula for calculating a conditional probability?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Find P(J | PB). Recall that 80% of people like peanut butter, 89% like jelly, and 78%
    like both.
  CorrectAnswer: 0.78 / 0.80
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(0.78 / 0.80)
  Hint: It may be helpful to write the information from the problem statement in probability notation.
    For example, P(PB and J) = P(both) = 0.78

- Class: text
  Output: After an introductory statistics course, 80% of students can successfully construct box
    plots. Of those who can construct box plots, 86% passed, while only 65% of those students who
    could not construct box plots passed. We want to find the probability that a student is able
    to construct a box plot if it is known that he passed.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which formula will we use to calculate this probability?
  CorrectAnswer: Bayes Theorem
  AnswerChoices: Bayes Theorem; conditional probability; addition rule; mutiplication rule
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Bayes Theorem')
  Hint: We know the probability that a student passed given that he can construct box plots.
    We want to flip this around and find the probability that a student can construct box plots given
    that he passed.

- Class: text
  Output: Let A be the event that a student passed the class. Let B be the event that a student can
    construct box plots.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is our desired probability?
  CorrectAnswer: P(B | A)
  AnswerChoices: P(A and B); P(B); P(A); P(B | A)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='P(B | A)')
  Hint: We want to find probability that a student is able to construct a box plot if it is given
    that he passed.

- Class: text
  Output: Let's write the information from the probability statement in our probability notation.

- Class: text
  Output: P(B) = 0.80, P(A | B) = 0.86, P(A | not B) = 0.65

- Class: text
  Output: Bayes Theorem gives us a way to rewrite P(B | A) = P(A and B) / P(A).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's start by calculating P(A and B) = P(A | B)P(B). Find this value now.
  CorrectAnswer: 0.86 * 0.80
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(0.86 * 0.80)
  Hint: Look back to where we wrote our information out in probability notation.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now we want to calculate P(A). Find this value now.
  CorrectAnswer: 0.80 * 0.86 + 0.20 * 0.65
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(0.80 * 0.86 + 0.20 * 0.65)
  Hint: Use the Law of Total Probability to calculate P(A). Remember that this is the sum of
    all of the joint probabilities where A occurs.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use these calculations to find P(B | A). Round your answer to 3 decimal places.
  CorrectAnswer: 0.841
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(0.841)
  Hint: Plug your calculations back into Bayes Theorem. Then carefully round to 3 decimal places.

  Output: Suppose we pick three people at random. For each of the following questions, ignore the
    special case where someone might be born on February 29th, and assume that births are evenly
    distributed throughout the year. Recall that there are 365 days in a year.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the probability that the first two people share a birthday? Enter your answer
    as a fraction.
  CorrectAnswer: (365/365) * (1/365)
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(1/365)
  Hint: The first person's birthday can be any day of the year. Then the second person's birthday must
    be on the specific day that the fist person's birthday falls on. What is the probability that
    person 2's birthday is on a specific day?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the probability that at least two of the three people share a birthday? Round to 3
    decimal places.
  CorrectAnswer: 1 - (365/365) * (364/365) * (363/365)
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(0.008)
  Hint: It may be easier to think of the probability that none of the people share a birthday and take
    the complement. Note that if my birthday is April 11, there is a 364/365 chance that you and I do
    not share a birthday.

  Output: An airline charges the following baggage fees $25 for the first bag and $35 for the second.
    Suppose 54% percent of passengers have no checked luggage, 34% percent have one piece of checked
    luggage and 12% percent have two pieces. Assume nobody checks more than two bags.

- Class: text
  Output: We can set this up in probability notation. Let X be the amount of money spent to check bags.
    Zero bags costs $0, one bag costs $25, and two bags costs $25 + $35 = $60.

- Class: text
  Output: P(no bags) = P(X = 0) = 0.54

- Class: text
  Output: P(one bag) = P(X = 25) = 0.34

- Class: text
  Output: P(two bags) = P(X = 60) = 0.12

  CorrectAnswer: 0.54 * (0-15.7)^2 + 0.34 * (25-15.7)^2 + 0.12 * (60-15.7)^2 # = 398.01
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(398.01)
  Hint: Double check the variance formula from Section 3.4 or from the Aug 6 course notes.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Find the standard deviation of the revenue per passenger. Since these quantities are in
    dollars, round your answer to 2 decimal places.
  CorrectAnswer: sqrt(398.01) = 19.95
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(19.95)
  Hint: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Remember to round to 2 decimal
    places.

  Output: Now Let's play with the following questions related to combination and permutation.


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: -- Question for you -- How many unique ways are there to arrange the letters in the word HEY?
  CorrectAnswer: There are 3 letters to choose for the first position, 2 for the second position and so on,  So  3 x 2 x 1 = 3 ! (this is called 3 fatorial) = 6.
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(6)
  Hint: Let me give you some hint. Starting from the first position, how many letters can you choose from? You can also try to write down all the possible choices since we are only dealing with 3 letters.

- Class: text
  Output: The way I solve it is like this. There are 3 choices for the first position, 2 choices for the second position and 1 choice for the last. So 3 x 2 x 1 = 6.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: -- Question for you -- How many unique ways are there to arrange the letters in the word DAISY?
  CorrectAnswer: There are 5 choices for the first position, 4 choices for the second position and so on,  So 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 5 ! (this is called 5 factorial) = 120.
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(120)
  Hint: Let me give you some hint.How many different choices (letters) you have to put on the first position, then second, then thid?


- Class: text
  Output: The way I solve it is like this.There are 5 choices for the first position, 4 choices for the second position and so on,  So 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 5 ! (which is called 5 factorial) = 120.



- Class: cmd_question
  Output: -- Question for you -- You just got a free ticket for a boat ride, and you can bring along 2 friends! Unfortunately, you have 5 friends who want to come along. How many different groups of friends could you take with you?
  CorrectAnswer: There are 5 choices for the first person you bring along, 4 choices for the second position. Because the order doesn’t matter and there are 2 different ways to order 2 people.  So 5 x 4/ 2 = 10
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(10)
  Hint: Let me give you some hint. How many different choices you have when choosing the first person, then the second? Does the order matter?


- Class: text
  Output: The way I solve it is like this. There are 5 choices for the first person you bring along, 4 choices for the second position. Because the order doesn’t matter and there are 2 different ways to order 2 people.  So 5 x 4/ 2 = 10.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: -- Question for you -- Stephanie is packing her bags for her vacation. She has 7 unique books, but only 3 fit in her bag. How many different groups of books can she take?

  CorrectAnswer: There are 7 choices for the first book you bring along, 6 choices for the second position and 5 choices for the third.  Because the order doesn’t matter and there are 3 x 2 x 1 different ways to order 2 people.  So 7 x 6 x 5 / (3 x 2 x 1) = 35.
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(35)
  Hint: Let me give you some hint. How many different choices you have when choosing the first person, then the second, the third? Does the order matter?

  CorrectAnswer: There are 5 choices for the first person you bring along, 4 choices for the second position. Because the order doesn’t matter and there are 3 x 2  different ways to order 3 people.  So 5 x 4 x 3 / 3 x 2 = 10
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(10)
  Hint: Let me give you some hint. How many different choices you have when choosing the first person, then the second then the third? Does the order matter?


- Class: text
  Output: The way I solve it is like this. Since we already calculated 5 choose 2 people in the previous question. Choose 3 people and 2 left should have the same number of possible results as choose 2 people and 3 left. So the answer is still 10.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: -- Question for you -- There are 10 basketball teams made to final round and only first and second place will get a medal. How many possible results could we have for first and second place?
  CorrectAnswer: One of the 10 teams can be the first place, then one of the 9 teams left can be the second place. Note the order does matter here, since we are talking about first and second place, So 10 x 9 = 90.
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(90)
  Hint: Let me give you some hint. First, think about the first place. How many teams could end up first? With the first place determined, then how many could end up 2nd? Does the order matter?


- Class: text
  Output: The way I solve it is like this. One of the 10 teams can be the first place, then one of the 9 teams left can be the second place. Note the order does matter here, since we are talking about first and second place, So 10 x 9 = 90.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: -- Question for you -- There are 10 basketball players and the coach need to pick 5 to make a team. How many different teams could be made?
  CorrectAnswer: When the coach pick the first player for the team, there are 10 choices. Then 9 choices for the second player, and so on. But we only care about who is in team, the order they were picked doesn’t matter. For the same group of 5 players, there are 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 5!  = 120 ways to order them but it’s the same team after all.  So 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 / 5! = 252
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(252)
  Hint: Let me give you some hint. Do you think this is 10 choose 5  or the order of players get picked matter?

- Class: text
  Output: Note that it gets messy when we did 10 choose 5 in the previous questions. Your calculation is 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 / 5!. What if we need to to 100 choose 24? Do you want to type the whole calculationin 100 x 99 x 98 x 97 x .... / 24!? Is there an easier way to do it?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In its most basic form, R is just a big calculator! We know 3 factorial is 3 x 2 x 1 = 6. Try to type factorial(3) and see if you get 6.
    and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: factorial(3)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='factorial(3)')
  Hint: Type factorial(3) and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: Now can we rewrite this expression 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 / 5!  using factorial?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: How about (10!/5!) / 5!. Try to type factorial(10)/ factorial(5) / factorial(5).
  CorrectAnswer: factorial(10)/ factorial(5) / factorial(5)
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value(252)
  Hint: Type ‘factorial(10)/ factorial(5) / factorial(5) ‘
