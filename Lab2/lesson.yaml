# associations
- Class: text
  Output: We will start today's lab thinking about associations between two numeric variables.

- Class: figure
  Output: The next few questions will involve these scatterplots (don't close out of them!).
  Figure: associations.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the plots show a positive association?
  CorrectAnswer: A and B
  AnswerChoices: A and B; A; B; D; A and D; C
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='A and B')
  Hint: In a positive association, as one variable increases, the other variable also increases.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the plots show a negative association?
  CorrectAnswer: D
  AnswerChoices: A and B; A; B; D; A and D; C
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='D')
  Hint: In a negative association, as one variable increases, the other variable decreases.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the plots show a linear association?
  CorrectAnswer: A and D
  AnswerChoices: A and B; A; B; D; A and D; C
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='A and D')
  Hint: A linear association is when the points fall around a (straight) line.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the plots show no association?
  CorrectAnswer: C
  AnswerChoices: A and B; A; B; D; A and D; C
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='C')
  Hint: If there is no association, you won't be able to draw a line/curve through the points.

# histograms
- Class: figure
  Output: Histograms show the distribution of data. This is an important consideration and something
    we think about a lot in statistics! For example, consider these four histograms.
  Figure: hists.R # run the R code to generate the 4 histograms
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What do these histograms have in common?
  CorrectAnswer: approximately the same means
  AnswerChoices: nothing; approximately the same means; approximately the same standard deviations;
    approximately the same means and standard deviations
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='approximately the same means')
  Hint: Look carefully at the histograms.

- Class: text
  Output: Right! They all come from populations with the same means (10). If we only looked at the
    averages, we would have no idea that we have four very different sets of data on our hands.

# mean and median
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Let's focus our attention on Histogram A. Do you expect the mean to be higher, lower, or
    about the same as the median?
  CorrectAnswer: about the same
  AnswerChoices: higher; lower; about the same
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='about the same')
  Hint: How do you think the middle of the data compares to the mean?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's check the details. First, let's see what the mean of our sample is. Remember that
    our population mean is 10. Type mean(v1) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: mean(v1)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mean(v1)')
  Hint: Type mean(v1) and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Great, now let's check the median. Type median(v1) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: median(v1)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='median(v1)')
  Hint: Type median(v1) and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: Both the mean and the median are close to 10, but notice that neither one is exactly 10.
    This is because v1 is a random sample of the population. We can get a good estimate of the true
    population mean, but we won't get the exact value.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Now focus on on Histogram D. Do you expect the mean to be higher, lower, or about the
    same as the median?
  CorrectAnswer: higher
  AnswerChoices: higher; lower; about the same
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='higher')
  Hint: How do you think the middle of the data compares to the mean?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's check the details. Let's see what the mean of our sample is. Remember that our
    population mean is still 10. Type mean(v4) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: mean(v4)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mean(v4)')
  Hint: Type mean(v4) and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Great, now let's check the median. Type median(v4) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: median(v4)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='median(v4)')
  Hint: Type median(v4) and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: Because our data has some outliers, the sample mean is quite a bit larger than the median.
    Sometimes, when we have outliers, the median gives us a better idea of the "middle" of the data
    than does the mean.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of these variables would be best represented by the median instead of the mean (choose
    the best answer)?
  CorrectAnswer: California household income
  AnswerChoices: California household income; height of UCR college students; duration of domestic flights
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='California household income')
  Hint: Which variable is most likely to have extreme outliers?

- Class: text
  Output: Right. There are likely to be some outliers in height and flight duration, but household income
    is likely to have the most extreme outliers. I certainly don't want my income compared to whatever Kim
    Kardashian pulls in each year.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Since R is a powerful calculator, there is one function  Type median(v4) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: median(v4)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='median(v4)')
  Hint: Type median(v4) and press Enter.

# standard deviations
- Class: text
  Output: Now let's think about the spread of a data set.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the following attributes can not describe the spread of a dataset?
  CorrectAnswer: Mode
  AnswerChoices: Variance; Standard deviation; Interquartile Range; Mode
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Mode')
  Hint: The spread often describes the average distance of each observation away from the center.

- Class: text
  Output: Looking at the four histograms, which dataset has the largest standard deviation?

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Think about the formular for calculating standard deviation, which number do you need to obtain
          before calculating the standard deviation?
  CorrectAnswer: mean
  AnswerChoices: mean; median; mode
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='mean')
  Hint: You need to find the center first. And this center is not robust to outliers.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If we want to calculate the standard devation for histogram A by hand.
          We need to know the data first. Type v1 to check the data.
  CorrectAnswer: v1
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='v1')
  Hint: Type v1 and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Looks like it will take you a long time to calculate the standard devation for this dataset by hand.
          But we can use R to help us. Type sd(v1) to obtain the standard devation for dataset v1.
  CorrectAnswer: sd(v1)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sd(v1)')
  Hint: Type sd(v1) and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Yes, it's that simple. For histogram B, now let's (let R) calculate standard devation for dataset v2.
          Type sd(v2) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: sd(v2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sd(v2)')
  Hint: Type sd(v2) and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now let's (let R) calculate standard devation for dataset v3 (Histogram C).
          Type sd(v3) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: sd(v3)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sd(v3)')
  Hint: Type sd(v3) and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now let's (let R) calculate standard devation for dataset v4 (Histogram D).
          Type sd(v4) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: sd(v4)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sd(v4)')
  Hint: Type sd(v4) and press Enter.
- Class: text
  Output: Look at all the standard deviations we just obtained. Which one is the largest?
          Did you guess it right?

- Class: text
  Output: Since the standard devation measures the average distance between each data point and the center.
          When most of the data are close to the mean, we expect a small standard devation, like in Histogram A.

- Class: text
  Output: Recall that all the histograms are generated using the same mean.
          When the data is skewed, we expect a larger standard devation, like in Histogram D.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Based on the standard deviation we just obtained, which of the histogram has the largest variance?
  CorrectAnswer: D
  AnswerChoices: A; B; C; D
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='D')
  Hint: Variance is just squared standard devation.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Consider three measures of spread, Variance, Standard Devation and Interquartile Range (IQR),
           which one is robust to outliers?
  CorrectAnswer: IQR
  AnswerChoices: Variance; Standard Devation; IQR
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='IQR')
  Hint: Which one is less influenced by outliers?

- Class: text
  Output: Which histogram do you think has the largest IQR? Is it also histogram D?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's theck the dataset for histogram D. Type v4 and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: v4
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='v4')
  Hint: Type v4 and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: R has a built-in function to calculate IQR. Type IQR(v4) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: IQR(v4)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='IQR(v4)')
  Hint: Type IQR(v4) and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now check IQR for histogram C. Type IQR(v3) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: IQR(v3)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='IQR(v3)')
  Hint: Type IQR(v3) and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now check IQR for histogram B. Type IQR(v2) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: IQR(v2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='IQR(v2)')
  Hint: Type IQR(v2) and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We know variance is standard devation squared. Let's see if this relationship holds based on results from R.
          Type sd(v2) ^2 == var(v2) and press Enter
  CorrectAnswer: sd(v2) ^2 == var(v2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sd(v2)^2 == var(v2)')
  Hint: Type sd(v2) ^2 == var(v2) and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: Notice the square is calculated using "^2" and variance is calculated by var(v2).

- Class: text
  Output: Then we use double '=' to let R do the check and return TRUE or FALSE.


# population and samples
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now let's spend some time thinking about populations and samples. The Tooth Growth dataset
    examines the relationship between different vitamin C supplements and tooth growth in guinea pigs.
    Start by loading the data. Type data(ToothGrowth) and then press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: data(ToothGrowth)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data(ToothGrowth)')
  Hint: Type data(ToothGrowth) and press Enter.

    Suppose we want to know which supplement type is better for increasing tooth growth rates in
    guinea pigs. What is the population in this study?
  CorrectAnswer: all guinea pigs
  AnswerChoices: all guinea pigs; all guinea pig teeth; all vitamin c supplements
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='all guinea pigs')
  Hint: Who or what is being sampled? (Recall that our sample recieves the treatment.)

# explanatory and response variables
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the explanatory variable?
  CorrectAnswer: supplement type
  AnswerChoices: supplement type; guinea pigs; tooth length
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='supplement type')

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the response variable?
  CorrectAnswer: tooth length
  AnswerChoices: supplement type; guinea pigs; tooth length
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='tooth length')
  Hint: Which variable do we think changes in response to something?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's make the tooth growth data R's top priority. Type attach(ToothGrowth) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: attach(ToothGrowth)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='attach(ToothGrowth)')
  Hint: Type attach(ToothGrowth) and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Do you think supplement type impacts tooth growth? We can use a boxplot to visualize this
    relationship. Type boxplot(len~supp) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: boxplot(len~supp)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='boxplot(len~supp)')
  Hint: Type boxplot(len~supp) and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: The boxplot shows two boxes, one for orange juice (OJ) and one for ascorbic acid (VC).
    The y-axis shows length of odontoblasts, the cells responsible for guinea pigs' tooth growth.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which supplement has a longer median cell length?
  CorrectAnswer: orange juice (OJ)
  AnswerChoices: orange juice (OJ); ascorbic acid (VC)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='orange juice (OJ)')
  Hint: Try again!

  Output: Which supplement has a greater spread in cell lengths?
  CorrectAnswer: ascorbic acid (VC)
  AnswerChoices: orange juice (OJ); ascorbic acid (VC)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='ascorbic acid (VC)')
  Hint: Try again!

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the approximate interquartile range for the cell lengths for guinea pigs who
    recieved orange juice?
  CorrectAnswer: 26-15=11
  AnswerChoices: 26-15=11; 31-8=23; 34-4=30; 23-11=12
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='26-15=11')

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Are there any outliers?
  CorrectAnswer: no
  AnswerChoices: yes; no
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='no')
  Hint: Try again!

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Now let's suppose that the guinea pigs recieved different doses of vitamin c supplements.
    We are interested in whether dosage has an effect on how supplement type impacts the guinea
    pigs' tooth growth. How might we include dosages?
  CorrectAnswer: do four boxplots using different combinations of supplement type and doses
  AnswerChoices: do four boxplots using different combinations of supplement type and doses; do a boxplot of the different doses; don't bother
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='do four boxplots using different combinations of supplement type and doses')
  Hint: Think back to what we talked about in class...

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can also visualize blocked data with boxplots! Think of each combination of treatment
    (supplement type) and block (dosage) as one "treatment". For example, OJ at 0.5 mg is one
    treatment setting and OJ at 1 mg is another treatment setting. Type boxplot(len ~ supp * dose)
    and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: boxplot(len ~ supp * dose)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='boxplot(len ~ supp * dose)')
  Hint: Type boxplot(len~supp*dose) and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: There are two treatments (OJ and VC) and three blocks (0.5, 1, and 2 mg doses), so there are
    2*3=6 total treatment settings. There are also 6 boxplots, one for each!

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which treatment/block combination has the lowest median tooth growth cell length?
  CorrectAnswer: VC with 0.5 mg
  AnswerChoices: VC with 0.5 mg; VC with 1 mg; VC with 2 mg; OJ with 0.5 mg; OJ with 1 mg; OJ with 2 mg
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='VC with 0.5 mg')
  Hint: The axis labels show each treatment setting as TREATMENT.DOSE. Which one has the lowest median?

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which treatment/block combination has a potential outlier?
  CorrectAnswer: VC with 1 mg
  AnswerChoices: VC with 0.5 mg; VC with 1 mg; VC with 2 mg; OJ with 0.5 mg; OJ with 1 mg; OJ with 2 mg
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='VC with 1 mg')
  Hint: The axis labels show each treatment setting as TREATMENT.DOSE. Which one has a potential outlier?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Earlier, we used the "attach" command to make the tooth growth data R's top priority, but now
    we're done looking at this data set. Let's free up R's memory for something else. Type
    detach(ToothGrowth) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: detach(ToothGrowth)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='detach(ToothGrowth)')
  Hint: Type detach(ToothGrowth) and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: Great! In this Lab 2, we are not going to work with any other datasets, but removing attached
    data from R's memory is a good habit to get into when we finish working with something.

- Class: text
  Output: You have successfully completed Lab 2! Way to go!
