# check if it's the correct Lab
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Lab 1 Week 1. Is this the correct lab? You must complete the lab for the correct week.
  CorrectAnswer: yes
  AnswerChoices: yes; no
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='yes')
  Hint: If you accidentally ended up in the wrong lab, press Esc to leave Swirl.
    Then type swirl() and press Enter to start over.

- Class: text
  Output: This lab is designed to get you working in R, a commonly used statistical
    programming environment. If you plan to go to graduate school, there is a good chance
    that you will be expected to work with R (or a similar software). If not, having
    some basic programming under your belt will help you on the job market!

- Class: text
  Output: These labs are designed to be easy to follow. Learning R is not a requirement
    for this course and you are welcome to copy everything down and do only what is necessary
    to finish your labs. However, you are encouraged to use the tools introduced during this
    course to experiment with R and learn more about this useful software tool!

- Class: text
  Output: If you decide to learn more about R, there are tons of free resources! Contact
    your instructor for recommendations or spend some time exploring your options online.

- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, we will explore some basic building blocks of the R programming
    language. We will use these to review some of the concepts discussed in class.

# basic calculation
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In its most basic form, R is just a big calculator! Try it out! Type 5 + 7
    and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: 5 + 7
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='5 + 7')
  Hint: Type 5 + 7 and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: R prints the result, 12, by default. However, R was designed to do a lot more
    than just work as a calculator! We can use R to do extended calculations, visualize
    data, automate processes, and more.

# variable
- Class: text
  Output: Suppose want to use our result from above in an extended calculation.
    Instead of retyping 5 + 7 every time we need it, we can create a new variable
    that stores the result.

- Class: text
  Output: 'The way you assign a value to a variable in R is by using the assignment
    operator, which is just a ''less than'' symbol followed by a ''minus'' sign. It
    looks like a little arrow pointing to the left: <-'

- Class: text
  Output: The assignment operator "assigns" a value to whatever variable name the arrow is
    "pointing" at.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To assign the result of 5 + 7 to a variable called x, type x <- 5 + 7. This can
    be read as 'x is assigned 5 plus 7'. Give it a try!
  CorrectAnswer: x <- 5 + 7
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('x <- 5 + 7', 'x <- 7 + 5')
  Hint: Type x <- 5 + 7

- Class: text
  Output: This time, R did not print the result. When you use the assignment operator,
    R assumes that we want to save that information for later instead of seeing it right
    away.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If we want to see what R has stored in x, we type x and press Enter. Try it out!
  CorrectAnswer: x
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='x')
  Hint: Type x and press Enter. This will automatically print the value of x.

# play with Cars dataset
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: For the rest of the lab, we will use one of R's many built in data sets. Type
    data(mtcars) and press Enter. This will load the data set into R's environment.
  CorrectAnswer: data(mtcars)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data(mtcars)')
  Hint: Make sure you have typed data(mtcars) exactly as it appears, with no spaces or
    capital letters.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now we are going to display the contents of the mtcars dataset. Type mtcars
    and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: mtcars
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mtcars')
  Hint: Make sure you mtcars exactly as it appears, with no spaces or capital letters.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You've successfully read the data set into R's environment and displayed it
    in a data matrix. Next, we will examine the mtcars data. Use the attach command to
    make this dataset R's top priority by typing attach(mtcars) and pressing Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: attach(mtcars)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='attach(mtcars)')
  Hint: Double check your spelling and make sure there are no spaces or capitalization.

# check variable names
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Then, check the variable names. Type names(mtcars) and press Enter to see
    the names of all of the variables in the mtcars data set.
  CorrectAnswer: names(mtcars)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='names(mtcars)')
  Hint: Type names(mtcars) exactly as it appears here.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now that we know the variable names, let's investigate some of the concepts from
    today's class. "mpg" is the miles per gallon for each car. Print the values from mpg by
    typing mpg and pressing Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: mpg
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mpg')
  Hint: Type mpg and press Enter.

# variable types
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What type of variable is mpg?
  CorrectAnswer: numeric
  AnswerChoices: categorical; numeric
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='numeric')
  Hint: 'Is this variable made up of numbers or categories?'

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Is mpg a discrete or continuous variable?
  CorrectAnswer: continuous
  AnswerChoices: discrete; continuous
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='continuous')
  Hint: Think about the values in mpg. Do they have decimal places?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's look at another variable, cyl. This is the number of cylinders. Type
    cyl and press Enter
  CorrectAnswer: cyl
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='cyl')
  Hint: Type cyl and press Enter.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What type of variable is cyl?
  CorrectAnswer: discrete numeric
  AnswerChoices: discrete numeric; continuous numeric; categorical
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='discrete numeric')
  Hint: Think about the possible number of cylinders.
    Are there jumps from one number to the next?

# introduce HELP function
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If we want to know more about anything in R, we can request the help file
    using a question mark before the thing we want to know about. Type ?mtcars and
    press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: ?mtcars
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='?mtcars')
  Hint: Type ?mtcars and press Enter.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Look at the help file to get more information on the variable am. What does this
    variable represent?
  CorrectAnswer: Transmission
  AnswerChoices: Rear axle ratio; Transmission; Radio
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Transmission')
  Hint: Look under the "Format" section in the help file for information on each variable.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What type of variable is am?
  CorrectAnswer: categorical
  AnswerChoices: discrete numeric; continuous numeric; categorical
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='categorical')
  Hint: What does am represent?

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What are the levels of am?
  CorrectAnswer: 0 = automatic 1 = manual
  AnswerChoices: 0 = automatic 1 = manual; A M; 0 = amplitude 1 = magnitude
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='0 = automatic 1 = manual')
  Hint: Look under the "Format" section in the help file for information on each variable.

# relationship between two variables
# plotting
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now let's think about the relationships between some of the variables. R has a lot
    of powerful plotting abilities, but let's stick to the basics for now with a simple
    scatterplot. Type plot(mpg, wt) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: plot(mpg, wt)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="plot(mpg, wt)")
  Hint: Type plot(mpg, wt) exactly as it appears.

- Class: figure
  Output: We can also add a title and axis labels with plot(x=mpg, y=wt, main="Scatterplot
    of MPG vs Vehicle Weight", xlab="MPG", ylab="weight (1000 lbs)").
    Here's what that looks like.
  Figure: scatter1.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What does the plot suggest about the relationship between miles per gallon and a
    vehicle's weight? What is the association between these two variables?
  CorrectAnswer: negative association
  AnswerChoices: positive association; negative association; no association
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='negative association')
  Hint: Is the trend upward or downward?

- Class: text
  Output: Does this relationship make sense to you? A really strange or unexpected relationship
    is cause for further investigation! In this case, it makes sense that heavier cars might use
    up more gas than lighter cars.

- Class: figure
  Output: Let's look at another plot. This time, we will examine the relationship between
    quarter mile time (qsec) and engine displacement (disp). The R command is plot(x=qsec,
    y=disp, main="Scatterplot of Quarter Mile Time vs Engine Displacement",
    xlab="1/4 Mile Time (sec)", ylab="Displacement")
  Figure: scatter2.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What does the plot suggest about the relationship between quarter mile time and engine
    displacement? What is the association?
  CorrectAnswer: no association
  AnswerChoices: positive association; negative association; no association
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='no association')
  Hint: Is there a visible trend?


- Class: text
  Output: Good job! Now it's time to play with R on your own.

# calculation
- Class: exact_question
  Output: Suppose you went grocery shopping and bought milk ($3.5), bread ($2), eggs ($1.7), bottled water ($5 + $1.2 CRV) and a bunch of flowers to decorate your room ($9). You also need to pay 9.25% tax on the flowers. Calculate how much money did you spend in total?
  CorrectAnswer: no association
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='23.2325')
  Hint: Did you include CRV and tax for flowers?
# save the result as a variable
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now let's create a variable called tax_rate. We want to assign the tax_rate of 9.25% to a variable called tax_rate. Give it a try!
  CorrectAnswer: tax_rate <- 0.0925
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('tax_rate <- 0.0925', 'tax_rate<-0.0925')
  Hint: We can assign values of 12 to variable x by "x <- 12"?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now we want to see what R has stored in tax_rate. What you need to type to get this information?
  CorrectAnswer: tax_rate
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='tax_rate')
  Hint: Type tax_rate and press Enter. This will automatically print the value of tax_rate.

# dataset
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's look at one of R's many built in data sets, "Titanic". Now, let's load the dataset into R's environment.
  CorrectAnswer: data(Titanic)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('data(Titanic)', 'data("Titanic")')
  Hint: In previous exercises, you typed data(mtcars) to load the data set of mtcars. The dataset name is case sensitive.
# help function
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We want to know more about this datafile. How could you bring out the help file for this dataset?
  CorrectAnswer: ?Titanic
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='?Titanic')
  Hint: Recall that you used "?mtcars" to bring out the help file for mtcars dataset.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Use the information in the help file of Titanic dataset. What type of variable is "Age"?
